# Sixfab-NB-IoT-EVB-Modem-Driver-
This project includes the Sixfab NB-IoT EVB Modem Driver codes. These codes are written in C language. This code is an example of Serial Port Programming. There are 3 main parts in the code. First part creates a file to send to the Sixfab NB-IoT EVB via serial port, second part writes the command into this file and Sixfab NB-IoT EVB is programmed according to the commands that we write in second part. Third part reads the responses which comes from the Sixfab NB-IoT EVB. If the response is "OK" code will proceed to send another command. After sending all the commands, Sixfab NB-IoT EVB is programmed completely and connected to the network.
